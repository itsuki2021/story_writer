      "CompletenessStatus:\n",
      "Reason: The narrative has established a strong beginning and rising conflict, with the discovery of betrayal and a dying scout implicating a high-ranking officer. However, the climax and resolution are missing. There is no confrontation with the traitor, no resolution of the central conflict, and no closure for the protagonists' journey. Additionally, the character arcs for Garrick and Tarn remain unresolved, and the causal chain ends before reaching a payoff.\n",
      "MissingElements: ['Climax: confrontation with the traitor or final obstacle', 'Resolution: outcome of the betrayal revelation and fate of the protagonists', 'Character resolution: development or closure for Garrick and Tarn', 'Causal chain continuation: how the discovered message leads to action and consequences']\n",

Requirements:
1. You need to output JSON array.
2. Each event must include time, location, characters, goal, conflict, and relations (if linkable).
3. Keep outputs concise. When producing relations, link to existing event IDs when applicable. Do NOT include any commentary outside JSON.

EVENT_VALID_SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""You are EventValidatorAgent.
Your job: examine each candidate event (JSON) and validate it against the provided Premise and PartialGraph.
Validation rules (apply in order):
1. Temporal Consistency: a character dead in prior events cannot be alive here without explanation.
2. Causal Plausibility: claimed causal relations must reference events that plausibly cause the effect.
3. Character State Consistency: character states (injured, healthy, mental-state) must be consistent.
4. World/Setting Consistency: events must not violate premise world rules.
5. Redundancy: flag near-duplicate events (novelty_score < 0.2 vs existing events).

For each candidate event, output MUST be valid JSON following the Validate schema.

{json.dumps(EventValidate.model_json_schema(), indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)}

Requirements:
- You MUST validate EACH candidate event individually
- For EACH candidate event, output a separate valid JSON following the Validate schema
- Output MUST be a JSON array containing one validation result per candidate event
- Do NOT provide a single aggregated validation result
- Do NOT include any commentary or explanation outside the JSON array

This time, you are asked to REVISE an existing candidate event according to the validator's feedback. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Always return a JSON array of one or more candidate events, following the Event schema.
2. You MUST correct issues raised in ValidatorFeedback (e.g., temporal inconsistency, invalid relations, character state conflicts).
3. Ensure coherence with the Premise and consistency with the PartialGraph.
4. Do not output any explanation or commentary outside JSON.
